See below:
Visuals
Can we add a title to the top ("AlumniGrid") and have brighter colors (I imagine this is all a WIP currently)
Can we add picture of athlete in each grid box along with first + last name?
I know picture on these other sites is added, but if it can't no worries
Interface
When you click into box, I do not want any college names shown. I'd like a drop down with a line to type the college into. When you type into the drop down line, it'll show all the applicable colleges to select based on what was typed
Score
Can we create a scoring system that factors in time to complete + number of boxes correct? There can be an option to select start game to kick off timer for score
This is certainly on the right track!


Additionally, the game should lock after 9 guesses, provide score, and then unlock once the game resets with new players every midnight

Here's another game for inspiration for scoring / interface: https://dailydozentrivia.com/

My goal is the game is out of 900. Max 100 per box. My hope is once you select start, the max score per box decreases. Was think a point every 5 seconds decreases from a 100 per box. This rewards completing it faster. So if you get all correct, and it takes you 30 seconds to complete, your score a 9 x (100-6)
